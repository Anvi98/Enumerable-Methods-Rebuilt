## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### To clone this repo run this code on a terminal window: 

git clone git@github.com:Anvi98/Enumerable-Methods-Rebuilt.git

### After you cloned the repo, you can test, each method and analyse them how they work
Here is how you can test:
- Move to the root of the folder, then type in your terminal:
````
rspec
````
- To make your own customization of test, you can directily edit the file : 'tests_spec.rb' inside the folder spec.

### Setup rspec
In case you've never used and installed rspec before, this is how you can install it easily.
- Open your terminal and run this command:
````
gem install rspec
````
- To make sure you've got the rspec, type:
````
rspec --version
````
- If you get a version showing up in your terminal, you are set now :-)
